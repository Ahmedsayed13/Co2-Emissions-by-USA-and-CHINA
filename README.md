# Co2-Emissions-by-USA-and-CHINA
Wrangling and analyzing carbon dioxide emissions emitted by USA and China from 1751 to 2017.

I got the co2 emissions data from kaggle, assessed the data from any quality or tidiness issues to make the data clean and tidy to make it's analysis easies,
i chose to compare between co2 emissions between china and the united states as china has a big progress in it's manufacturing and production which would cause a huge amounts of data.

The insights from the analysis is very clear:
- China was not emitting any noticable co2 emissions until the begininng of 1970. 
- China exceeded the co2 emissions emiited by the united states from 2010 till now.
- China is the factory of the world.
